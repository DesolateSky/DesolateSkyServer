# Desolate Sky Minecraft Server

This is a project I work on for fun in my free time, and is a work in progress.
If you would like to give suggestions or feedback, feel free to create an issue or join the [discord server]([https://discord.gg/p8RWreq8Dz](https://discord.gg/qPg2GT2gMA)).
I am also open to PR's or people joining me in working on the project if interested. 
I make no guarantees about whether or not this project will ever be completed and/or if I will release it as a server that will make a profit.

I will never make this repository not public, but I cannot guarantee that in the future I will continue to work on the project and continue to upload the code publicly.

Additionally, I am a college student so I don't have a lot of free time to dedicate to this project during school. 

Here is the YouTube channel where I occasionally post features: [https://www.youtube.com/@DesolateSkyMc](https://www.youtube.com/@DesolateSkyMc).
